# ETL Project: COVID-19 Vaccination and Search Insights Data

# Overview

  This project processes a COVID-19 vaccination and search insights dataset, performs data transformation and cleaning using Python, and outputs the cleaned dataset for further analysis. 
  The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is implemented in a Jupyter notebook to prepare the dataset for data analysis and visualization.

# Python Environment Setup

   To ensure compatibility, set up a Python environment with the following libraries:

  -  pandas

  -  numpy

# Install Required Python Libraries

   Run the following command to install the necessary packages:

    bash
    
        pip install pandas numpy

# Querying the Dataset

  The following code snippet retrieves data from the covid19_vaccination_search_insights.csv file using Pandas:

    python

        import pandas as pd
    
        data = pd.read_csv('covid19_vaccination_search_insights.csv')
    
        print(data.head())  # Preview the data

# Data Transformation with Pandas

After loading the dataset, data transformation is performed using Pandas. Steps include:

  1  Removing Duplicates: Eliminate duplicate rows.

  2  Handling Missing Values: Fill missing values with 'unknown' for categorical fields.

  3  Data Type Conversion: Convert columns such as Postal Code, Vaccination Rate, and Search Trends to numeric types.

  4  Standardizing Text: Convert string fields to a consistent text case.

  5  Aggregating by Region: Aggregate data by region for easier analysis.

Example Code for Data Transformation

      python
      
          import pandas as pd
          import numpy as np
      
          # Remove duplicates
          data = data.drop_duplicates()
      
          # Fill missing values
          data['Region'].fillna('unknown', inplace=True)
          data['Vaccine Provider'].fillna('unknown', inplace=True)
      
          # Convert specific columns to numeric
          data['Postal Code'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Postal Code'], errors='coerce').astype('Int64')
          data['Vaccination Rate'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Vaccination Rate'], errors='coerce')
          data['Search Trends'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Search Trends'], errors='coerce')
      
          # Preview cleaned data
          print(data.info())
          data.to_csv('Covid_Transformed_data.csv', index=False)
          
   # Exporting Data
        
  Once the data is cleaned and transformed, it is saved as a CSV file for further analysis or visualization:
      
      python
            data.to_csv('Covid_Transformed_data.csv', index=False)
            print("Data has been saved as Covid_Transformed_data.csv.")
  
  # How to Run the Code
     
  1  Clone the repository:
      
      bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
        Install dependencies:
      
  2   Run the command below to install required libraries:
      
      bash
        pip install pandas numpy

  3  Run the ETL notebook: Open the ETL_Covid.ipynb notebook in Jupyter and run the cells to process and transform the data.

# Project Files

  1  covid19_vaccination_search_insights.csv: The original dataset containing raw COVID-19 vaccination and search insights data.

  2  Covid_Transformed_data.csv: The cleaned and transformed dataset, ready for analysis.

  3  ETL_Covid.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that implements the ETL pipeline, transforming raw data for easy analysis.

# Conclusion

This ETL pipeline provides a full process for loading, transforming, and saving COVID-19 vaccination and search insights data. 

This project can be extended with further analyses or visualizations to gain deeper insights into vaccination trends.
